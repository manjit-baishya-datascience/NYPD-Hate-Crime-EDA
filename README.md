This project is an analysis of the crimes in **NYPD** over various factors. The data has been sourced from [**this**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjitbaishya001/nypd-hate-crimes) Kaggle dataset and the corresponding [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/manjitbaishya001/nypd-hate-crime-eda) notebook has been also linked.

## **About the Dataset**
The dataset has not been cleaned before hand. It has been originally sourced from [**data.gov**](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-hate-crimes). It provides a list of **Hate Crimes** conducted by people in **NYPD.** It comprises of `13` features. Some of them are:
- **Full Complaint ID:** Provides a unique complaint ID
- **Complaint Year Number:** Year of complaint
- **Month Number:** Month of complaint
- **Record Create Date:** Date of record creation
- **Complaint Precinct Code:** Code of complaint precinct code

NYPD hate crime data analysis delves into uncovering trends in the data, both in terms of temporal patterns, like changes over time, and geospatial distribution, identifying areas with higher concentrations of hate crimes. Examining the details of the data, including offense types, associated law codes, bias motivations behind the crimes, and arrest trends, provides a deeper understanding of the nature of these incidents and how law enforcement responds.

This project is dedicated to determine the key points responsible for crimes in `NYPD`. Analysis has been done through various measures - including categorical, temporal and spatial points. It has been accompanied with visualizations wherever necessary.

## **Data Analysis**

### `Step 1:` Importing Data
In this step, we import all required `libraries` for the analysis and also the `source file` itself.

### `Step 2:` Data Cleaning
In this step, we clean the data of any null values.

### `Step 3:` Data Pre-Processing
In this step, we make our data ready foir analysis - extracting only required features, creating new features from existing ones, fixing date-time formats, renaming columns and so on.

### `Step 4:` Analysis 
Here, we perform all sorts of temporal, categoriccal and geospatial analysis on the given data.

### `Step 5:` Visualization
Here, we use `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to visualize our data.

### `Step 6:` Conclusion
Some conclusions drawn from the analysis on each instance.
